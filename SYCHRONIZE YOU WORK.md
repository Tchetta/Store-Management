## Open any terminal and navigate to your project location
 If you're using vscode's terminal then no need to navigate to your project as you already are in.
 
### Copy and paste the following code to the terminal.
 Replace [mybranch] with the name of your branch.

```bash
    git pull
    git pull origin
    git checkout main
    git pull
    git checkout [mybranch]
    git pull
    git fetch origin
    git merge main
    git push
```
